# supervised-machine-learning-challenge


In this project, we aim to build a model that can predict whether or not loan applicants are safe enough to be approved for a loan using logistic regression and random forest classifier. The differences between the two are:

* Logistic regression is a linear model, while random forest classifier is a non-linear model.
* Logistic regression estimates the probability of the outcome, while random forest classifier uses an ensemble of decision trees to make predictions.
* Logistic regression is a simpler and more interpretable model, while random forest classifier can capture more complex relationships but may be harder to interpret.
